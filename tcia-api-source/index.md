# Overview

The TCIA API provides a programmatic interface that allows you to integrate your applications with The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Once integrated, you can give users of your applications the ability to search and download the over 20million public images on TCIA. The API complements the existing web interface but eliminates the need for users to visit the TCIA web pages to select and download images then upload them into their viewing and analysis applications. The TCIA Programmatic Interface is based on a middleware platform called Project Bindaas, developed by Emory University and uses REST web service technologies.

We have language bindings in Java, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

Every request must contain an API-Key. It uniquely identifies you & your application on the TCIA system. You can obtain one API-KEY and use that for your application; you do not need a separate API-KEY for each user of your software. **We strongly recommend that you not share the key or commit it to SCM.**  

To obtain an API-Key:
1. Create an account on TCIA
2. Send a request here

The key can be included in the url by adding an extra query parameter api_key or it can be included in the HTTP headers.


> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json

    "fluffiness": 6,
